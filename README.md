# NewIOR
Additional index of refraction values for use with POV-Ray - The Persistence of Vision Raytracerâ„¢.

This is initially based on the v4.10b that I released back in 2001-03-09, my use of POV-Ray have been rather infrequent since then. But I have now started to "play around" with it a little bit.

The latest release is still available on a free webhosting site, but I don't have the password to it anymore. I also don't have access to the email address the site was registered with... ;-)

So instead, I decided to put it up here on Github and update it for newer versions of POV-Ray, the latest version I did back in 2001 was for POV-Ray v3.1.
